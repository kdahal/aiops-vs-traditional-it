# ðŸ©¹ Resolution: Suggested and Automated Remediation

This final phase of the AIOps cycle focuses on accelerating the time to recovery (MTTR) by moving beyond human diagnosis and into automated or assisted resolution.

## Traditional IT Operations: Reliance on Tribal Knowledge

* **The Challenge:** Once the root cause is identified, the fix often depends on specific **human experts** or "tribal knowledge"â€” undocumented procedures known only to a few long-term team members.
* **The Process:** The engineer must manually execute a runbook, which might involve restarting a service, rolling back a configuration, or scaling an instance. This is prone to human error, especially under pressure, and is slow.
* **Scaling Limit:** Every incident requires human hands-on-keyboard time, making IT operations expensive and incapable of scaling with the velocity of cloud infrastructure changes.

## The AIOps Solution: Learning from Success

AIOps systems leverage the history of successful resolutions to either suggest the best fix to the human operator or, for low-risk issues, automatically execute the remediation action.

### Key AIOps Techniques Used:

1.  **Runbook Automation (RBA) / Workflow Engine:**
    * This is the foundation where documented procedures (e.g., "Restart Web Server A") are converted into executable code.
2.  **Reinforcement Learning and Historical Matching:**
    * The system analyzes past incidents: "When **Probable Cause X** was identified, **Action Y** successfully resolved the issue 95% of the time."
    * Based on this confidence score, AIOps can provide a **suggested resolution button** to the operator, or, if the confidence is high and the risk is low, execute the resolution autonomously.
3.  **Proactive Healing:**
    * AIOps can detect early anomalies (from the Anomaly Detection phase) and automatically perform minor, non-disruptive actions like increasing a connection pool limit or clearing a log file **before** the anomaly escalates into a full-blown incident.
4.  **Action Orchestration:**
    * The system integrates with different cloud and service management tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Terraform, ServiceNow) to execute actions across multiple cloud providers seamlessly.

## ðŸ“ˆ The Result: Shifting from Reactive to Self-Healing

The ultimate goal of resolution automation is to create a **self-healing infrastructure** where systems fix known problems automatically, freeing up human experts to focus on complex, novel issues and innovation.
