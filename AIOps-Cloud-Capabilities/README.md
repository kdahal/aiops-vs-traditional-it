# üöÄ AIOps Capabilities Across Multiple Clouds: A Comprehensive Comparison

This repository provides a detailed comparison of key **AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations)** capabilities against traditional IT Operations methods, highlighting the necessary shift for managing complex multi-cloud environments.

## üìä Core Capability Comparison

The table below illustrates how AIOps moves IT operations from a reactive, manual state to a proactive, automated, and intelligent system.

| Capability | Traditional IT Operations | AIOps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alert Management** | Floods teams with isolated alerts from different systems | **Correlates related alerts into single incidents**, reducing noise by 90%+ |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Requires manually set thresholds for every metric | **Automatically learns normal patterns** and detects deviations |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Requires manual investigation across multiple tools and logs | **Automatically identifies probable causes** based on patterns and relationships |
| **Resolution** | Manual, dependent on human experts and tribal knowledge | **Suggests or automates remediation** based on previous successful resolutions |
| **Optimization** | Periodic, manual performance tuning based on static rules | **Continuous, automated identification of optimization opportunities** (e.g., resource, cost) |

## üîó The AIOps Operational Flow

These capabilities form a continuous, intelligent loop:

1.  **Anomaly Detection** identifies potential problems by learning what is *normal* (not just what hits a static number).
2.  **Alert Management** takes the resulting events and *correlates* them into a single, high-fidelity incident.
3.  **Root Cause Analysis** diagnoses the incident to provide the most *probable cause*.
4.  **Resolution** uses the cause to *suggest or execute* automated remediation.
5.  **Optimization** continuously tunes the infrastructure to *prevent* these issues and save costs.
